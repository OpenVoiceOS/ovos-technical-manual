# How to Install Open Voice OS with the `ovos-installer`

Welcome to the quick-start guide for installing Open Voice OS (OVOS) using the official `ovos-installer`! This guide is suitable for **Raspberry Pi** and **desktop/server** Linux environments. Whether you‚Äôre running this on a headless Raspberry Pi or your everyday laptop, the steps are mostly the same‚Äîonly the way you connect to the device differs.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Some ‚Äúexotic‚Äù hardware (like ReSpeaker microphones or certain audio HATs) may require extra configuration. The installer aims for wide compatibility, but specialized setups might need some manual intervention.

Looking for a pre-built raspberry pi image instead? check out [raspOVOS](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/raspOVOS) and the companion [tutorial](https://openvoiceos.github.io/ovos-technical-manual/51-install_raspovos/)

## Step-by-step Installation

### ‚úÖ 1. Connect to Your Device *(if remote)*

If you're installing on a headless device (like a Raspberry Pi), connect via SSH:

```bash
ssh -l your-username <your-device-ip>
```

---

### üîÑ 2. Update Package Metadata

Make sure your package manager is up to date:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

---

### üì¶ 3. Install Prerequisites

Install `git` and `curl`‚Äîthese are required to run the installer:

```bash
sudo apt install -y git curl
```

---

### üì• 4. Run the OVOS Installer

Now you're ready to kick off the installation process:

```bash
sudo sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenVoiceOS/ovos-installer/main/installer.sh)"
```

---

## What Happens Next?

Once you run the script, the installer will:

- Perform system checks
- Install dependencies (Python, Ansible, etc.)
- Launch a **text-based user interface (TUI)** to guide you through the setup

This can take anywhere from **5 to 20 minutes**, depending on your hardware, internet speed, and storage performance. Now let‚Äôs walk through the installer screens!

---

## The Installer Wizard

Navigation:

- navigation is done via arrow keys
- pressing space selects options in the lists
    - eg. when selecting `virtualenv` or `containers`
- pressing tab will switch between the options and the `<next>`/`<back>` buttons
- pressing enter will execute the highligted `<next>`/`<back>` option

---

### üåç Language Selection

The first screen lets you select your preferred language. Just follow the on-screen instructions.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Some features (like the GUI) may be unavailable on lower-end hardware like the Raspberry Pi 3B+.

---

### üçì Raspberry Pi Tuning *(if applicable)*

On Raspberry Pi boards, you‚Äôll be offered system tweaks to improve performance. It's highly recommended to enable this!

### üìä Anonymous Telemetry

You'll be asked whether to share **anonymous usage data** to help improve Open Voice OS. Please consider opting in!

![image](https://gist.github.com/user-attachments/assets/b8015c41-370d-49d3-b783-996887cb421b)

The data collection only happens during the installation process, nothing else will be collected once the installation is over.

**The installer will ask you if you want to share or not the data.**

Below is a list of the collected data _(please have a look to the [Ansible tempalte](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/ovos-installer/blob/main/ansible/roles/ovos_installer/templates/telemetry.json.j2) used ti publish the data)_.

## Additional Configuration and Known Issues

Depending on your language you probably want to change the default plugins, the ovos-installer is not perfect and might not always select the best defaults

It is recommend that you run `ovos-config autoconfigure --help` after the initial install
