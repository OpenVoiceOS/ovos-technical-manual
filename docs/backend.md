# Available Backend Services

## Supported Backends

ovos-core supports multiple backends under a single unified interface

- Personal backend - [self hosted](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/OVOS-local-backend)
- Offline - support for setting your own api keys and query services directly
- Selene - https://api.mycroft.ai , will go down any day now and is in the process of being deprecated
- Neon - NeonMQ backend native integration is [coming soon!](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/ovos-backend-client/pull/11)

Developers do not need to worry about backend details in their applications and skills

## Identity Information

A unique uuid and pairing information generated by registering with Home is stored in:
`~/.config/mycroft/identity/identity2.json` <b><-- DO NOT SHARE THIS WITH OTHERS!</b>

This file uniquely identifies your device and should be kept safe


## STT Plugin

a companion stt plugin is available to use a backend as remote STT provider

It is recommended you use [ovos-stt-server](https://openvoiceos.github.io/ovos-technical-manual/stt_server) instead, this plugin is being deprecated together with selene

edit your configuration to use ovos-stt-plugin-selene

```json
{
  "stt": {
    "module": "ovos-stt-plugin-selene"
  }
}
```

## Offline Backend

OVOS by default runs without a backend, in this case you will need to configure api keys manually

This can be done with [OCA](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/ovos-config-assistant) or by editing mycroft.conf

edit your configuration to use the offline backend

```json
{
  "server": {
    "backend_type": "offline"
  }
}
```


## Personal Backend

Personal backend is a reverse engineered alternative to selene that predates it

It provides the same functionality for devices and packs some extra options

It is not intended to serve different users or thousands of devices, there are no user accounts!

This is currently the only way to run a vanilla mycroft-core device offline

edit your configuration to use your own personal backend instance

```json
{
  "server": {
    "backend_type": "personal",
    "url": "http://0.0.0.0:6712",
    "version": "v1",
    "update": true,
    "metrics": true,
    "sync_skill_settings": true
  }
}
```

## Selene

The official mycroft home backend is called selene, users need to create an account and pair devices with the mycroft
servers.

With Mycroft's demise this backend may go down any day now, the last effort from mycroft developers was to prepare dinkum for this event.

Support is in the process of being fully removed for ovos-core 0.0.8

Selene is AGPL licensed:
- [backend source code](https://github.com/MycroftAI/selene-backend)
- [frontend source code](https://github.com/MycroftAI/selene-ui)

edit your configuration to use the selene backend

```json
{
  "server": {
    "backend_type": "selene",
    "url": "https://api.mycroft.ai",
    "version": "v1",
    "update": true,
    "metrics": true,
    "sync_skill_settings": true
  }
}
```
