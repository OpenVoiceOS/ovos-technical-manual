# The OpenVoiceOS Technical Manual

Welcome to the OVOS developer documentation

if you are not looking to develop with OpenVoiceOS the [community-docs](https://openvoiceos.github.io/community-docs) might be more suitable for your needs

## Perspective

OVOS aims to be a full voice operating system, a operating system needs many applications and frameworks, OVOS provides all the required tooling to integrate voice in your projects

The typical use case for OVOS is as a voice assistant, `"Hey Mycroft, what is ..."`, but as a voice operating system OVOS makes no such assumptions and can be customized for any other use case, 
we have seen our community integrate OVOS on robots, furniture, smart mirrors, cloud applications, TVs and more!

The following companion projects can be seen as "OVOS distros", opinionated combinations of OVOS packages to provide a full voice assistant stack

- [raspOVOS](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/raspOVOS) - optimized for raspberry pi, built on top of [Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)

- [ovos-buildroot](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/ovos-buildroot) - production ready minimal linux for embedded devices, based on [ovos-docker](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/ovos-docker/) and [buildroot](https://buildroot.org/)

- [ovos-installer](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/ovos-installer) - setup OVOS on top of an existing OS

In these docs you will find info about the architecture of OVOS, the several kinds of plugins available, and OVOS application development guidelines.
