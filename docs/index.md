# The OpenVoiceOS Technical Manual

![](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/ovos_assets/blob/master/Logo/ovos-logo-512.png?raw=true)

Welcome to the **Open Voice OS (OVOS)** developer documentation. This guide is your starting point for exploring, building, and contributing to OVOS — an open and modular platform for voice-enabled applications.

## What is OVOS?

**Open Voice OS (OVOS)** is a flexible voice platform that goes beyond traditional voice assistants. It provides the foundational tools and frameworks for integrating voice interaction into a wide range of projects.

While OVOS can power a “Hey Mycroft…”-style assistant, it is not limited to that use case. As a voice operating system, OVOS is highly customizable and has been used in:

- Robots and automation systems  
- Smart furniture and mirrors  
- Cloud-based voice services  
- Embedded devices and smart TVs  

OVOS is designed to work wherever voice interfaces are needed — whether that’s on a local device or in the cloud.

## 🖥️ OVOS Distros

If you’d rather not install and configure components manually, OVOS has several prebuilt distributions:

- [**raspOVOS**](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/raspOVOS): A Raspberry Pi image with pre-installed OVOS services.
- [**ovos-installer**](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/ovos-installer): Installs OVOS on top of supported Linux systems.
- [**ovos-buildroot**](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/ovos-buildroot): A highly customizable buildroot-based image (in development).

These distros offer a faster setup experience with curated default skills and settings.
